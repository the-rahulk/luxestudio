# 🚀 AWS Amplify Deployment Guide for LuxeStudio

## ✅ Your Project is Now Amplify-Ready!

Your project has been successfully configured for AWS Amplify deployment with:
- ✅ React 18 (compatible with all dependencies)
- ✅ Fixed version conflicts 
- ✅ Removed problematic dependencies (Expo, React Native)
- ✅ Working build process
- ✅ Amplify configuration file

## 📋 What Was Fixed:

### Dependencies Updated:
- **React**: Downgraded from 19 to 18.2.0 (better compatibility)
- **Three.js**: Updated to 0.168.0 (fixes mesh-bvh issues)
- **Framer Motion**: Fixed to 10.16.16 
- **@react-three/drei & fiber**: Fixed to compatible versions
- **Removed**: Expo, React Native dependencies (not needed for web)

### Configuration Files:
- ✅ **`amplify.yml`** - Amplify build configuration
- ✅ **`.nvmrc`** - Node.js version (18)
- ✅ **`next.config.mjs`** - Simplified for Amplify
- ✅ **`package.json`** - Fixed all version conflicts

## 🚀 Deploy to AWS Amplify:

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for Amplify deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Connect to Amplify
1. Go to [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
2. Click **"New App"** → **"Host web app"**
3. Select **GitHub** as your source
4. Authorize Amplify to access your GitHub account
5. Select your repository: `luxestudio-brand`
6. Select branch: `main`

### Step 3: Configure Build Settings
Amplify will automatically detect the `amplify.yml` file and use these settings:
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Output directory**: `.next` (Next.js build output)
- **Node.js version**: 18 (from `.nvmrc`)

### Step 4: Environment Variables (if needed)
Add these in Amplify Console → Environment variables:
```
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 5: Deploy!
1. Click **"Save and deploy"**
2. Amplify will automatically:
   - Install dependencies
   - Run the build
   - Deploy your app
   - Provide a live URL

## 🌐 Your Live Website
After deployment, you'll get a URL like:
`https://main.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com`

## 🔧 Custom Domain (Optional)
1. In Amplify Console → Domain management
2. Add your custom domain: `luxestudio.live`
3. Amplify will handle SSL certificates automatically

## 📊 Features You Get with Amplify:
- ✅ **Automatic deployments** on every Git push
- ✅ **SSL certificates** (HTTPS by default)
- ✅ **Global CDN** for fast loading worldwide
- ✅ **Branch deployments** for testing
- ✅ **Build logs** for debugging
- ✅ **Custom domains** with automatic SSL
- ✅ **Form handling** (if you add contact forms)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting:

### If build fails:
1. Check the build logs in Amplify Console
2. Ensure all dependencies are compatible
3. Verify `amplify.yml` configuration

### If deployment is slow:
- Node.js 18 is specified in `.nvmrc`
- Dependencies are cached between builds
- Build artifacts are optimized

### If you need to update:
1. Make changes locally
2. Test with `npm run build`
3. Push to GitHub - Amplify auto-deploys!
